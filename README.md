## Introduction

The challenge required developing a fullstack coffee application with the following features:

- Display a list of coffee items fetched from a backend API.  
- Add new coffee items through a validated form.  
- Persist coffee data in a database.  
- Match the UI/UX of the design provided in Figma: [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/C4n0EqxCqKuu6Or4okx7qO/Coding-Challenge-2.0).  

The starter repository included **basic frontend and backend boilerplates**. I refactored and extended the project structure for clarity, maintainability, and scalability, while implementing all required functionality and ensuring alignment with best practices in modern web development.

## Tech Stack

This project uses **Next.js as a fullstack framework**, enabling both frontend and backend functionality in a single unified project. Below is a detailed overview of the technologies and why they were chosen:

### Frontend & Backend (Fullstack Next.js)

- **Next.js (App Router)**  
  - Provides a **unified framework** for both frontend and backend development. Using API routes for backend operations and React-based components for the frontend simplifies the development workflow, reduces context switching, and ensures tight integration between client and server logic.  
  - The App Router introduces a **clear separation between server and client components**, improving performance, maintainability, and scalability.  
  - Server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities allow faster initial page loads, SEO optimization, and better performance for dynamic data.

- **React 19**  
  - Core library for building interactive, dynamic, and responsive user interfaces.  
  - Reactâ€™s component-based architecture encourages **reusability, separation of concerns, and maintainability**â€”key qualities for a scalable application.  
  - Paired with Next.js, React ensures smooth UI rendering and efficient client-side updates.

- **TailwindCSS v4**  
  - Utility-first CSS framework that allows rapid, consistent styling directly in the markup.  
  - Tailwind promotes **design consistency**, reduces the need for custom CSS files, and makes the frontend codebase easier to maintain.  
  - Perfect for faithfully implementing Figma designs with minimal overhead.  

- **Shadcn/UI**  
  - Lightweight, accessible, and customizable UI component library built on TailwindCSS.  
  - Speeds up the development of reusable, accessible components without enforcing opinionated styling, allowing for flexibility in adhering to the Figma design.

- **SWR (Vercel)**  
  - Efficient client-side data fetching library that provides caching, revalidation, and synchronization out-of-the-box.  
  - Minimizes unnecessary network requests and ensures the UI remains consistent with backend data.  
  - Reduces boilerplate code and promotes reactive, responsive frontend behavior.

- **Framer Motion**  
  - Animation library for React that provides smooth transitions, gestures, and micro-interactions.  
  - Improves **user experience** by making UI elements feel interactive, polished, and professional.

### Database

- **Supabase / PostgreSQL**  
  - Supabase provides a **fully managed PostgreSQL database** with authentication, storage, and real-time capabilities.  
  - Using PostgreSQL ensures **data integrity, relational data support, and scalability**, essential for a robust fullstack application.  
  - A seeding mechanism was implemented to pre-populate the database with initial coffee items for immediate testing.

## Architecture & Design Decisions

The architecture was designed for **scalability, maintainability, and modern development standards**:

1. **Fullstack Next.js**  
   - Consolidates frontend and backend in a single project.  
   - API routes manage backend logic, database queries, and validation, reducing deployment complexity.  
   - Client components consume backend data via SWR, enabling reactive and real-time updates where necessary.

2. **Component-Based Frontend**  
   - Reusable React components with clear separation of concerns.  
   - TailwindCSS and Shadcn/UI ensure design consistency and accessibility across components.

3. **Efficient Data Management**  
   - SWR handles caching and automatic revalidation, minimizing server load and improving responsiveness.  
   - Backend validation ensures **data integrity**, preventing duplicate coffee entries and enforcing consistent data structures.

4. **Animations and Micro-Interactions**  
   - Framer Motion provides polished UI feedback, enhancing UX without compromising performance.

5. **Database & Persistence**  
   - Supabase/PostgreSQL guarantees persistent, structured, and scalable data storage.  
   - Includes seeding scripts for quick project setup and testing.

## Setup & Running the Project

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v22.20.0 (LTS)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager installed
- Supabase Account 

### Installation

````

### Testing

This project includes a robust testing and code quality setup to ensure reliability and maintainability:

- **ESLint & Prettier**  
  Enforces consistent code style and catches potential errors early during development.
- **TypeScript**  
  Provides static type checking to reduce runtime errors and improve developer confidence.

## Future Improvements / What I Would Do With More Time

While the application fulfills all the core requirements of the MVST coding challenge, given more time, I would focus on enhancing **functionality, scalability, and user experience**. Below are the key areas I would prioritize:

### 1. Advanced Features for Coffee Management
- **Edit & Delete Coffee Items**  
  Implement the ability to edit existing entries and delete coffees, with confirmation modals to prevent accidental changes.
- **Categorization & Filtering**  
  Enable filtering or sorting coffee items by type, roast level, or flavor profile for easier navigation.
- **Search Functionality**  
  Add a search bar with debounced input for quickly finding specific coffee items.

### 2. User Accounts & Personalization
- **Authentication & Authorization**  
  Introduce Supabase Authentication so that only logged-in users can add, edit, or delete coffee items.
- **User Preferences**  
  Save user-specific preferences such as favorite coffees, recent searches, and custom notes for each coffee.

### 3. Enhanced UI/UX
- **Improved Animations**  
  Extend the use of Framer Motion for smooth page transitions and interactive hover effects.
- **Responsive Design Improvements**  
  Fine-tune mobile and tablet layouts for a fully optimized cross-device experience.
- **Theme Switch**  
  Implement a toggleable dark/light mode using TailwindCSS and Next-Themes JavaScript library.

### 4. Performance & Scalability
- **Pagination & Infinite Scroll**  
  Implement server-side pagination or infinite scrolling for large coffee catalogs.
- **Optimized API & Caching**  
  Leverage stale-while-revalidate caching and possibly edge functions for faster API responses.

### 5. Testing & Reliability
- **Unit & Integration Tests**  
  Add tests using Jest and React Testing Library to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.
- **End-to-End Testing**  
  Use Cypress or Playwright to validate critical user flows, such as adding a coffee or fetching the coffee list.

### 6. Analytics & Insights
- **Usage Tracking**  
  Integrate analytics to track user interactions, popular coffees, and new item additions.
- **Admin Dashboard**  
  Build a lightweight dashboard for monitoring coffee statistics, user activity, and app health.


## Feedback

Working on this challenge was an exciting opportunity to combine frontend and backend development in a fullstack application. 

- Gaining deeper familiarity with **Next.js App Router** and server-client integration.
- Designing a clean **component-based frontend** with TailwindCSS and Shadcn/UI for a polished, Figma-accurate interface.
- Implementing a **persistent backend** with Supabase/PostgreSQL and ensuring data validation and integrity.
- Learning to prioritize **scalability, maintainability, and UX consistency** under time constraints.
- Applying best practices for **modern fullstack development**, including SWR for reactive data fetching and Framer Motion for micro-interactions.

Overall, the challenge was very well-structured, and it provided freedom to make architectural decisions while following design specifications. The instructions were clear, and the Figma file was very helpful in guiding the UI development.
